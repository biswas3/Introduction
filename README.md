# Article (Grammar)

An **article** is any member of a class of dedicated words that are used with [noun phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase) to mark the identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. The category of articles constitutes a [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech).

## Types of articles

- Definite article
- Indefinite article

### Definite article

A **definite article** is an article that marks a [definite noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) phrase. Definite articles such as English _the_ are used to refer to a particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.

_For example_,

1.  Give me the book.
2.  Keep the book in the shelf.

### Indefinite article

An **indefinite article** is an article that marks an [indefinite noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) phrase. Indefinite articles are those such as English _some_ or _a_, which do not refer to a specific identifiable entity. Indefinites are commonly used to introduce a new discourse referent which can be referred back to in subsequent discussion:

1.  A monster ate a cookie. His name is Cookie Monster.

Indefinites also have predicative uses:

1.  Leaving my door unlocked was a bad decision.

Indefinite noun phrases are widely studied within linguistics, in particular because of their ability to take [exceptional scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(formal_semantics)#Exceptional_scope).

[Tanya Reinhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Reinhart) pioneered the structural approach to scope.

# Hypertext Markup Language

The **HyperText Markup Language**, or **HTML** is the standard [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) for documents designed to be displayed in a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). It can be assisted by technologies such as [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and various [scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language).

## Markup

HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like `<h1>` and `</h1>`, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example `<img>`. The first tag in such a pair is the _start tag_, and the second is the _end tag_ (they are also called _opening tags_ and _closing tags_).

Another important component is the **HTML document type declaration**, which triggers **standards mode rendering**.

The following is an example of the classic ["Hello, World!" program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program):

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
        <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
