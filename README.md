# Article (Grammar)

An **article** is any member of a class of dedicated words that are used with [noun phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase) to mark the identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. The category of articles constitutes a [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech).

## Types of articles

- Definite article
- Indefinite article

### Definite article

A **definite article** is an article that marks a [definite noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) phrase. Definite articles such as English _the_ are used to refer to a particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.

_For example_,

1.  Give me the book.
2.  Keep the book in the shelf.

### Indefinite article

An **indefinite article** is an article that marks an [indefinite noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) phrase. Indefinite articles are those such as English _some_ or _a_, which do not refer to a specific identifiable entity. Indefinites are commonly used to introduce a new discourse referent which can be referred back to in subsequent discussion:

1.  A monster ate a cookie. His name is Cookie Monster.

Indefinites also have predicative uses:

1.  Leaving my door unlocked was a bad decision.

Indefinite noun phrases are widely studied within linguistics, in particular because of their ability to take [exceptional scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(formal_semantics)#Exceptional_scope).

[Tanya Reinhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Reinhart) pioneered the structural approach to scope.
